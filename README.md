| [purescript-abc-tutorial](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/purescript-abc-tutorial)    | interactive ABC tutorial                           |
| [purescript-school-of-music](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/purescript-school-of-music) | port of the Haskell Scool of Music |
| [keyboard player](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/purescript-midi/tree/master/examples/keyboard)            | play a MIDI keyboard through the browser  |

All these projects run in the browser and use Pux/smolder to generate the HTML. The projects share various libraries whose interdependencies are shown below. These include various players which are implemented as autonomous Pux modules.

elm
---

Much of the same ground is covered in the elm projects.  However, these are no longer being actively maintained - in favour of the purescript implementations.

scala
-----

[musicrest](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/musicrest) is the backend for [tradtunedb](http://www.tradtunedb.org.uk/).

haskell
-------

[MidiToAbc](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/MidiToAbc) attempts to convert a monophonic MIDI melody into the ABC notation.
